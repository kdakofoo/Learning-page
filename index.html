  <div class="content">The Korat is a living good-luck charm in his home country of Thailand, where he is also known as the Si-Sawat cat. The
    silver-blue cats with the emerald-green eyes are said to date to the 14th century based on their depiction in ancient
    literature. They were popular gifts, always presented in pairs, and had special meaning when given to brides because
    of their association with prosperity and fertility. The name Korat comes from the region in northeast Thailand where
    the cats are thought to have originated.</div>
